# Audio Recorder with Login and Signup

This is a React Native app that allows users to record audio, manage their recordings, and authenticate using login and signup features. The app provides an easy-to-use interface for audio recording and playback, along with secure user authentication.

## Features

- **User Authentication:**
  - Signup and login functionality.
  - Secure user authentication using Firebase.
  
- **Audio Recording:**
  - Record audio directly from the app.
  - Playback recorded audio.
  
- **Recording Management:**
  - Save, delete, and manage recordings.
  
- **User-Friendly Interface:**
  - Intuitive controls for recording, playback, and managing audio files.

## Technologies Used

- React Native (Expo)
- Firebase Authentication (for user login/signup)
- Firebase Firestore (for saving user recordings)
- Expo Audio (for recording and playback)
- React Navigation (for app navigation)
- Styled-components (for styling)

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:
- Node.js (version >= 16.x)
- npm or yarn (for package management)
- Expo CLI (for running React Native apps)
- Firebase account (for authentication and data storage)

### Steps to Set Up the Project

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/khanyajara/Audio-recorder-with-login-and-signup.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Audio-recorder-with-login-and-signup
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or if you're using yarn
   yarn install
   ```

4. Set up Firebase:
   - Create a Firebase project at [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
   - Enable Firebase Authentication (Email/Password sign-in).
   - Set up Firebase Firestore (for storing recordings).
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following Firebase configuration variables:
     ```bash
     REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=<your-firebase-api-key>
     REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=<your-firebase-auth-domain>
     REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=<your-firebase-project-id>
     REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=<your-firebase-storage-bucket>
     REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=<your-firebase-messaging-sender-id>
     REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID=<your-firebase-app-id>
     ```

5. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   expo start
   ```

   This will open a browser window. Scan the QR code with the Expo Go app on your mobile device to run the app, or use an emulator.

## Features Walkthrough

1. **User Authentication:**
